Please construct an model of an ideal 12-bit, 10MS/s SAR ADC in python. 

This should consist of a sample and hold circuit, comparator, control logic, SAR register, and DAC. Please create each of these components in separate functions.

Vin should be a cosine wave from 0 to 5V, 1 MHz.

The DAC should have a Vref input = 5V.

The SAR ADC should produce a binary output, which goes to the DAC.

The two inputs of the comparator are the output of the S/H circuit and the output of the DAC.

The output of the comparator is the input to the control logic.

The output of the control logic is the SAR Register.

The SAR register needs 12 clock cycles to complete the SAR algorithm for a 12-bit ADC. However, keep in mind this is different from the S/H clock, which is much slower. All 12 clock cycles of the SAR needs to complete before the S/H clock.

Please plot the binary output and display the output of each stage for debugging.
